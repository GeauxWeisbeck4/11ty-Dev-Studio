# Creating Engaging Digital Experiences Using 11ty

The first time I ever used Eleventy was a special experience for me. I had just learned how to program a full-stack application from scratch and felt overwhelmed from writing all of the code to serve each request to the browser using the MEAN Stack and wondered how anyone could get anything done with so much extra code to write just to serve a template. Then I ran `npx eleventy --serve` after following a tutorial and saw the magic of a super fast static site generator unfold before my eyes. I've used the Jamstack ever since - really, Eleventy mostly.

Depending on your level of understanding in regards to what that first paragraph just said, you likely made one of two conclusions:

  1. 11ty Dev Studio exists because I am too lazy to write out a MEAN Stack application.
  2. There is something to this 11ty project and maybe Andrew can help my business out.

Either way, I decided to make a brand as a part of my freelance business/overall business portfolio that is solely dedicated to 11ty because:

  - It is easy to use
  - Has fast builds and makes super fast websites
  - There is zero configuration and it is very stable
  - You can use any templating framework you'd like
  - The community just flat out rocks

Eleventy also gave me the confidence to iterate and ship ideas quickly, allowing me to start freelancing earlier in my career and saving me a lot of trouble. I learned through the enormous selection of educational contributions from 11ty developers and I even now have this business website listed on the [11ty Super Professional Business Network](https://www.11ty.dev/super-professional-business-network/).

Now, don't get me wrong - I never stopped doing full-stack development because I felt 11ty was a one stop solution for everyone and every programming situation. More than anything, I learned how to quickly create efficient static sites and was introduced into a broader ecosystem of Jamstack tools and libaries. As a natural entrepreneur, I have created different brands to handle various client requests and you can check out my other solutions/brands at the bottom of the page if you don't think 11ty is right for your project.

## Why Not Try a Free Consultation First?

Before you leave this page and go somewhere else because either you don't feel Eleventy is right for your project or you don't understand what 11ty does, I urge you to schedule a free project consultation appointment first. I promise I'm not going to push any of my solutions on you, nor will I recommend 11ty if I don't think its going to be appropriate for your project.

But why not schedule a free project consultation first and you can get a free, professional opinion on your project/idea before you go pay somebody else $100 for the very same thing? A pretty good deal right?

If you have a website, I will conduct an audit and give you my analysis and recommendations for next steps. Fair enough. If you don't have anything yet but maybe some designs or just an idea in your head, I will sit down on a call with you and brainstorm a quick project plan and you will get my opinion on how to best proceed.

So you should understand a couple things about me - I'm not here to take your money, steal your idea, or even prove to you I'm the best web developer you'll ever meet. I really love what I do and get excited seeing people realize their dreams when we connect the dots through our work together. I'm fortunate enough to be a part of your success and would never steer anyone towards a decision that would set them up for failure.

I'm a pretty laid back guy who is very serious about ethics and my values. Those values include authenticity, honesty, empathy, trust, and ambition - and not ambitious as in seeking glory and wealth, but rather as being a part of a successful partnership that makes the world better than it was the day before. I actually do not like money - it is an unneccessary evil that causes all of our problems as humans, but I do understand that I need it to survive and businesses need responsible care of budgets to survive. 

## Seriously, Let's Talk!

If you're still reading this, that's all I really am going to share for now. You now have to schedule your free consultation so we can get to know each other better and see if our partnership would make sense or not.
